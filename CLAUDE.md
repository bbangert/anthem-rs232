# anthem-rs232

Async Python library for two Anthem RS-232 protocol generations:

- **Gen 2** (top-level package): MRX x10 (310/510/710), MRX x20 (520/720/1120), AVM 60. `;`-terminated, 115200 8N1, `Z?POW`/`Z?VOL`/`Z?MUT`/`Z?INP` zone-prefixed commands. Spec: Feb 2016.
- **Gen 1** (`anthem_rs232.gen1` subpackage): Statement D1/D2/D2v, AVM 20/30/40/50/50v, MRX 300/500/700. LF-terminated, 9600 or 19200 baud (per model), `P{zone}{verb}{arg}` shape. Command set ported from `rsnodgrass/python-anthemav-serial` (AVM-2 spec, 21 Nov 2000).

Modeled on `home-assistant-libs/denon-rs232`.

**Not supported**: STR amplifiers, Gen 4 (MRX 540/740/1140 + AVM 70/90 — different protocol with `GC*`, `NM*`, `SS*`, split `Z1ARC*` commands), MRX SLM (IP-only).

## Architecture

### Gen 2

- Uses `serialx` (`open_serial_connection`) for async serial I/O at **115200 8N1**.
- Framing: `<COMMAND><PARAM>;` (semicolon terminator). Queries append `?`: `Z1POW?;`.
- Successful set commands echo back. Queries return `<COMMAND><PAYLOAD>;`.
- Errors: `!E<orig>` (cannot execute), `!R<orig>` (out of range), `!I<orig>` (invalid command), `!Z<orig>` (zone off, system not in standby).
- `connect()` opens the port, verifies with `Z1POW?` (3-attempt retry for flaky proxies), then sends `ECH1;` to enable auto-reports.
- `query_state()` queries identification, inputs (`ICN?` + per-input `ISNyy?`/`ILNyy?`), and per-zone state.
- Built on **serialkit** (`serial-toolkit` on PyPI, imported as `serialkit`): each receiver owns a `serialkit.SerialLink` (via the shared `ReceiverRuntime` base in `_runtime.py`), so the read loop, framing, pacing, the idle watchdog and reconnect all live in the toolkit. The driver supplies the command surface, `on_connect` (identify/verify + enable auto-reports), and a sync `on_frame` event dispatcher (`_apply_event`) that mutates state. Framing is `DelimiterFramer(b";", strip=b"\x00")` (Gen 2) / `DelimiterFramer(b"\n", strip=b"\x00")` with an inline `;` split in `on_frame` (Gen 1); the NUL scrub handles the stray bytes receivers emit around ECO-standby transitions. Queries use `link.confirm(...)`, which arms before the send and **observes without consuming** — the reply is both the caller's answer and an event that `on_frame` applies. An error reply fails the in-flight waiters via `link.report_error(...)`: Gen 2 echoes the failing command, Gen 1 emits a bare English phrase, and neither can be attributed to more than "whatever is waiting now". The watchdog is `IdleProbe(idle=60 s, probe=…, attempts=3)` — `Z1POW?` (Gen 2) / `?` identify (Gen 1), both answered in standby; any RX (including an error reply) counts as alive, and the retry covers ECO standby eating the first frame as MCU wake-up. Pacing is `Pacing(min_interval=30 ms)`, an engineering margin for a link with no flow control rather than a spec-quoted gap. Subscribers receive state snapshots, coalesced in `on_turn` so a burst of reports is one callback; zone players read through the receiver's live state.
- Subscribers receive `ReceiverState` on changes, `None` on disconnect.

### Gen 1

- Uses `serialx` at **9600 or 19200 baud** (per model — D2/D2v: 19200, others: 9600).
- Framing: ASCII commands LF-terminated. Multiple commands chainable with `;`.
- **Set commands return nothing on success** -- queries are the only reliable way to confirm state.
- Errors are verbose ASCII: `Invalid Command`, `Parameter Out-of-range`, `Main Off`, `Zone2 Off`, `Unit Off`, `Already in use`. Raised as `Gen1CommandError` on whatever query is in flight.
- `connect()` opens the port, sends `?` to identify (parses `(model,version,build)`), then sends `SST1` to enable Tx Status auto-report frames.
- `query_state()` issues `P1?`, `P2?`, `P3?`, `H?`, `TT?`.
- Queries use a **matcher callable** rather than a prefix string — the receiver may answer several message shapes for the same query (e.g. the tuner responds `TFT...` or `TAT...`). The matcher returns the decoded value, and `_query` re-runs it on the resolved frame to produce the caller's result.

## Key design decisions

### Gen 2

- Inputs are **numeric**, not enum values. Anthem inputs are user-configured; their names come from `ISN?`/`ILN?` and live in `state.inputs`.
- **One query/response model**: every query returns exactly one response (or one error).
- Prefix matching is longest-first (`_PREFIXES_BY_LEN`).
- `Z0POW` events update both zones + a synthesized aggregate `state.power` ("any zone on" → True; "all zones off" → False).
- Volume is integer dB only (per spec: "Entry is rounded to nearest valid value"). Format is `±NN` (e.g. `Z1VOL-35`, `Z1VOL+05`).
- Per-input settings (`SLIP` lip sync, `SDVS`/`SDVL` Dolby Volume) live on `InputConfig`; an event/report for input `00` is applied to the currently selected input. Pending queries are matched by `startswith`, so indexed query prefixes (`SPN1`, `SLIP02`, `Z1LEV3`) resolve even though the response-prefix table only holds the base command.

### Gen 1

- Inputs are **single-character codes** (`Source` enum: `0`-`9` + `d`-`j`). Map to display names via `model.source_map`.
- Volume is a **dB float with one decimal**. Main: 0.5 dB step (`P1VM`); Zone 2 / Headphone: 1.25 dB step (`P2V` / `HV`). Note Zone 2 uses `P2V` not `P2VM`.
- **Per-source decoder/effect modes** stored as `dict[source_code, DecoderMode]` / `dict[source_code, EffectMode]` on `MainZoneState` because the receiver remembers a different mode per source.
- The Rec / Zone 3 (`P3?`) only carries source -- modeled as `RecZoneState` with just `source`.
- Headphone path is a separate object (`Headphone` class) since it has its own `H?`/`HV`/`HM` commands.

## Testing

- `pytest` with `pytest-asyncio`, `asyncio_mode = "auto"`.
- Gen 2: `MockSerialConnection` in `conftest.py` -- real `asyncio.StreamReader`, mock writer; `_on_write` auto-responds to `?`-suffixed queries from `_query_responses`.
- Gen 1: `MockGen1Serial` in `test_gen1.py` -- same pattern, but matches against full command bytes (because Gen 1 has no universal "?" suffix), splits chained `;` commands before matching.
- 172 tests total.
- Run: `uv run pytest` or `python -m pytest tests/`
